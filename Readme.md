## Deploy

I deploy this project using firebase Hosting.
- First you need to run a preview using `npm run preview` Which deploys a preview app to a url in the response
- Then you deploy with `npm run deploy` which deploys to the live url
- Optionally you can use `BRANCH={branch} npm run preview` and `BRANCH={branch} npm run deploy` to preview and deploy at an env different then sandbox
